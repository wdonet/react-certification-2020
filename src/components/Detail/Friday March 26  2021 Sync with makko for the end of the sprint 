Notification hub: a couple of spikes 

Removed tickets: 
https://wizeline.quip.com/oqKBAdr oObjZ/Autocomplete-APIs-for-Video-Manager-UI

	Autocompletes for league/teams
		will use sportsdata/v1 endpoints. 


	For talents, even though there's a person api, there's no search functionality. They also are ingesting from mpx and it will probably be removed in the future to use gracenote. 

The new tickets involve adding hydra to some of the enpoints. 

	One thing missing is to add the query params into all the links included in the response, so we should handle that. 
	cpe-ms-title-search service uses hydra so we can use that as a base for our code.
